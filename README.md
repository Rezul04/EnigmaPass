## Password Detecting Feature
A password detector using a **trie data structure** efficiently checks the strength of passwords.<br> Each character in a password is stored in a trie, where **nodes represent characters** and edges denote transitions. Leaf nodes indicate the end of a **valid password pattern**.<br> This structure allows quick searches to determine if a password matches known weak patterns or common dictionary words.<br> By navigating the trie based on input characters, the detector evaluates** password strength** based on **complexity, length, and avoidance of predictable sequences.** <br>This approach ensures rapid and scalable **detection of weak passwords**, enhancing overall **security measures.**
